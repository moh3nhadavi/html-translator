# HTML Translator
In this script, I used `selenium` to open a browser and translate parsed html files in a directory.

### Variables to set
1. At line 85, you should replace `directory` value with your own path. 
2. At line 86, you should replace `target_language` value with your own target value. 

More details are commented in the code.
